- [setuptv](https://github.com/Alisson328/dotfiles/blob/main/setuptv "setuptv shell script"): a little shell script to set up my TV when I connect it to laptop. it also set my sound card to output audio via HDMI and, for last, replace one word in i3status configuration file to don't bug my volume's indicator. remember to restart i3 to take effect.
